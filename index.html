    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="#" alt="me" width="200px">
    <p>Hello everyone my name is Orlando, yes like the city in Florida. I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to Web Devolpment,
        I have self taught myself in HTML so this is'nt to hard for me to do. I really enjoy coding because I like the diffuculty
        that come with it. Theres plenty to learn about it so I am very excited to learn more. I very much enjoy to play
        video games as that is what I do with my free time. There is alot of differnet games that I play ranging from puzzles
        to shooters and even fighting games. My all time favorite game is the Halo franchise.
